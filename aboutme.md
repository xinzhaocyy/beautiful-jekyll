My name is Xin. Iâ€™m a master student of MaSC of Electrical Engineering at the University of Toronto. I enjoy playing with datasets in different domains to learn more about data science. I love things on the web and occasionally attempt to make some of them. I also find the Image Processing and artificial intelligence very interesting!
